The product has the following features,
    * There is a login/signup page which acts as the single entry point.
    * The 2FA part of the project is aided by google's Firebase Auth which requests the user's phone number and a captcha for the secondary factor of authentication.
    * A TOTP(Time bases One Time Password) is sent to the user to grant access to the home page.
    * The signup form also stores a token on the django database using Json Web-tokens which is later retrived in compiling the profile page.
